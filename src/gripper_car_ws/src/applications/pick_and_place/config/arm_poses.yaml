# =============================================================================
# Arm Poses Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Custom joint positions for pick-and-place operations.
#
# Joint names (from arm URDF):
#   - joint_1: Base rotation (shoulder pan)
#   - joint_2: Shoulder pitch
#   - joint_3: Elbow pitch
#   - joint_4: Wrist pitch
#   - gripper_base_joint: Gripper rotation
#
# All values are in radians.
#
# Note: Named poses like "home", "stowed", "open", "closed" are defined
# in MoveIt SRDF and accessed via move_group.set_named_target()
