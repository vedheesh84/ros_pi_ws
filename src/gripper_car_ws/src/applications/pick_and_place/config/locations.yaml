# Named Locations Configuration
# =============================================================================
# Maps QR code content (location names) to navigation coordinates.
#
# Each location has:
#   - x, y: Position in map frame (meters)
#   - theta: Orientation (radians, 0 = facing +X, pi/2 = facing +Y)
#
# The QR code on objects should contain the location name (e.g., "station_A")
# which is then looked up in this file to get navigation coordinates.
#
# Special locations:
#   - pickup: Where the robot picks up objects
#   - default: Fallback if QR code content is not recognized
# =============================================================================

locations:
  # Pickup station - where objects with QR codes are placed for pickup
  pickup:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    theta: 0.0  # Facing forward (+X direction)

  # Delivery stations - destinations encoded in QR codes
  station_A:
    x: 2.0
    y: 1.0
    theta: 1.57  # Facing +Y (90 degrees)

  station_B:
    x: 3.0
    y: -1.5
    theta: 0.0  # Facing +X

  station_C:
    x: -1.0
    y: 2.0
    theta: 3.14  # Facing -X (180 degrees)

  # Default fallback location if QR code content is unknown
  default:
    x: 0.5
    y: 0.5
    theta: 0.0
